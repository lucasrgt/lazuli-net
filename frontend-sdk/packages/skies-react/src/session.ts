// must remember. Collapsing `loading` into `anonymous` is THE canonical guard bug (a freshly-signed-in user bounced
// back to the login screen because the guard read the session before it settled); this union makes it unspellable.

/**
 * The three terminal facts a route guard needs, as one closed union. `loading` means defer the decision; the other

 *   the me-query (the seam pattern an app owns), it returns to pending here — so the guard waits for the
 *   authenticated fetch instead of reading the stale anonymous snapshot. This is the fix for the
 *   "register → bounced back to login" bug.
 * - **a TRANSIENT error (`isError` with `isUnauthorized === false`) ⇒ loading.** A 5xx / timeout / offline flap on
 *   `me` is NOT a sign-out — folding it into `anonymous` logs an authenticated user out on an F5 over a shaky
 *   network (they bounce to login, and re-login fails too). So a classified non-auth error DEFERS: stay on the
 *   splash, let react-query retry, recover to `authenticated` when it does. (Pair with a `useSession` timeout so a
 *   permanently-down API can't pin the splash forever.)
 * - **an AUTH error or absent data ⇒ anonymous.** A 401/403 on `me` is not a failure surface; an unauthenticated
 *   visitor is a normal state. (So the session never routes through a `<Resource>` error slot.)
 * - **data ⇒ authenticated**, carrying the user.
 *
 * `isFetching` is deliberately NOT folded into `loading`: a background revalidation of an already-signed-in session
 * must stay `authenticated` (no blank flash). The post-sign-in wait is guaranteed by RESETTING the query (→
 * pending), not by watching fetches.
 *
 * @typeParam U - the authenticated user the query resolves to.
 * @param query - the structural `me` query result.
 * @returns the closed session state a guard branches on.
